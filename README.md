## Configuring OpenAI Services üõ†Ô∏è

After setting up your environment variables, you need to configure the OpenAI services in the `config/services.php` file. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `config/services.php` file in your preferred text editor.
2. Find the commented `openai` service variable.
3. Uncomment the `openai` service variable by removing the `/*` and `*/` around it.

Your `config/services.php` file should look like this:

``` 
<?php

return [

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Third Party Services
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | This file is for storing the credentials for third party services such
    | as Mailgun, Postmark, AWS and more. This file provides the de facto
    | location for this type of information, allowing packages to have
    | a conventional file to locate the various service credentials.
    |
    */

    'postmark' => [
        'token' => env('POSTMARK_TOKEN'),
    ],

    'ses' => [
        'key' => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
        'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
        'region' => env('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION', 'us-east-1'),
    ],

    'resend' => [
        'key' => env('RESEND_KEY'),
    ],

    'slack' => [
        'notifications' => [
            'bot_user_oauth_token' => env('SLACK_BOT_USER_OAUTH_TOKEN'),
            'channel' => env('SLACK_BOT_USER_DEFAULT_CHANNEL'),
        ],
    ],

    //uncomment this code
    
    'openai' => [
         'api_url' => env('AZURE_BOT_API_URL'),
         'api_key' => env('AZURE_BOT_API_KEY'),
    ],

];

```

Make sure to replace `your_api_key` `your_api_endpoint` with your actual OpenAI API key in the `.env` file:

```
AZURE_BOT_API_URL=your_api_endpoint
AZURE_BOT_API_KEY=your_api_key
```


Now your Bot services are configured and ready to use!
